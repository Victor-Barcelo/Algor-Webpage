Static- Works in relation to pageflow (default)
Relative- Works in relation to pageflow and allows top, left, bottom, right properties
Absolute- working in relation to the page itself and is taken out of pageflow
Fixed- working in relation to the page itself and is taken out of pageflow

z-index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).

div1-absolute inside a div2-relative, div1 is absolute en relation to div2

* Parallax:
    bg: set as fixed, we change top with js (relate scroll -> top)
    other elements: set as absolute inside a fixed container, we change their tops with js (relate scroll -> top)
    ->So, we are fixing elements and moving them manipulating their top css property. This movement is linked
    to some other parameter, such as a scroll
    ->We can choose to not manipulate a dynamic element, ie that one is related to scroll, and manipulate the others
    related to this ones position.

    ->fine tune. padding-top to imgs and articles (same amount) why?
